1. After installation  navit application works in default demo mode.
You can browse map, create routes and the application can navigate in demo mode.


2. If you want to run navit in full mode that uses gpsd as a source of gps data, you should
edit /usr/share/navit/navit.xml on the target:

Find line:
<vehicle name="Demo" profilename="car" enabled="yes" active="yes" source="demo://"/>
and set enabled="no"

Find line:
<vehicle name="Local GPS" profilename="car" enabled="no" active="1" source="gpsd://localhost" gpsd_query="w+xj">
and set enabled="yes".

3. Currently after navit package installation there is no map installed on the target.
To install a map you should first download this from http://maps5.navit-project.org/ 
in bin format and copy to the target /home directory.

4. You should change the initial map position in the target's /usr/share/navit/navit.xml
by editing a line:

	<navit center="521040 N 210173 E" zoom="128" tracking="1" orientation="-1" recent_dest="10">

and replace 'center' value with coordinates corresponding to your map.

See for details: http://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Configuration


5. Currently you can run navit from wayland terminal:
navit
