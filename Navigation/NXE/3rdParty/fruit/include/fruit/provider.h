/**
 * A Provider is a class that allows access to instances of the types used as parameters of the Provider template.
 * It's possible to inject a Provider<MyClass> instead of MyClass itself, and this allows lazy injection.
 * For example:
 * 
 * class S {
 * private:
 *   Bar* bar = nullptr;
 *   
 * public:
 *   INJECT(S(Foo* foo, Provider<Bar> barProvider)) {
 *     if (foo->needsBar()) {
 *       bar = barProvider.get();
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * In the example above, Bar will only be created if get<Bar*> is called.
 * This can be useful if Bar is expensive to create (or some other types that need to be injected when a Bar is injected are)
 * or if there are other side effects of the Bar constructor that are undesirable when !foo->needsBar().
 * It's also possible to store the Provider object in a field, and create the Bar instance when the first method that needs it is
 * called:
 * 
 * class S {
 * private:
 *   Provider<Bar> barProvider;
 * 
 * public:
 *   INJECT(S(Provider<Bar> barProvider))
 *   : barProvider(barProvider) {
 *   }
 *   
 *   void execute() {
 *     if (...) {
 *       Bar* bar = barProvider.get();
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * As usual, Fruit ensures that (at most) one instance is ever created in a given injector, so if the Bar object was already
 * constructed, the get() will simply return it.
